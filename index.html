Two people using one monolithic persona to post about ‘our day off’ or ‘our doctor’s appointment’ or a book ‘we liked’ is not acceptable. And it doesn’t get any better when they use ‘I’ or ‘me,’ because then we aren’t sure if they mean Lisa or Greg or what.”“By the way, if Lisa seriously thinks this shared account is going to prevent Greg’s old girlfriends from finding a way to contact him, she’s fooling herself,” Tomkins continued. “He’s right there on LinkedIn.”FTC officials also argued that Facebook should split up the account as soon as possible to prevent the couple from merging it with the separate but equally weird one they have for their dog.</td></tr><tr style='background-color: #009879;color: #ffffff;text-align: left;' ><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >Report: Iran Less Than 10 Years Away From 2016</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >2007-08-08T01:03:00-05:00</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >WASHINGTON, DC—According to an alarming new Department of Defense report combining civilian, military, and calendric evidence, Iran may be as few as nine years away from the year 2016.

Unfortunately, none of what transpired in our psyches will show up on the body-cam footage, but we can assure you that the many witnesses who claim the man was complying and had his hands up must have been tricked by another one of the suspect’s psychic projections.” Daniels added that officers on scene deeply regretted shooting the man, as he had implanted false memories in their brains to convince them he was their best friend.</td></tr><tr style='background-color: #009879;color: #ffffff;text-align: left;' ><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >Millions Of Policy Proposals Spill Into Sea As Brookings Institution Think Tanker Runs Aground Off Crimea Coast</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >2017-07-13T10:55:00-05:00</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >YALTA, CRIMEA—In what is being called the worst environmental disaster in the region’s history, millions of policy proposals gushed into the Black Sea on Thursday after a Brookings Institution think tanker ran aground off the coast of Crimea. “Cleanup crews are working around the clock to contain this massive flood of position papers on economics and global development,” said Brookings Institution president Strobe Talbott, adding that booms had been brought to the site to halt the spread of the nonpartisan research while skimmers had been deployed to collect the policy briefs from the ocean’s surface in hopes of preventing currents from dispersing them over a far greater area. “We’re doing our very best to limit the exposure of marine habitats to the analyses of sub-Saharan energy infrastructure, universal basic income, and automation in the labor market, but it could be months before we know the full extent of the damage.” Talbott went on to say that the Brookings Institution had already pledged $200 million toward cleanup efforts thanks to generous donations from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the Hutchins Family Foundation, and the John D. and Catherine T.

Obviously, you can never be too careful with these things. If it were to spread to the galactic halo it could quickly trigger a collapse of the entire cosmos, so we’re glad we caught it when we did.” NASA officials confirmed treatment would begin right away with the launch of a rocket on a multimillion-year mission to target the malignant cluster with its first dose of chemo.</td></tr><tr style='background-color: #009879;color: #ffffff;text-align: left;' ><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >'Expect Delays' Signs Placed Randomly Throughout Nation</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >2001-11-28T15:00:01-06:00</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >WASHINGTON, DC—Expanding upon the already omnipresent signage at airports and on highways, the government has posted more than 150 million "Expect Delays" signs at random locations across the U.S. "I went to Safeway to buy some groceries, and there's a big sign warning me to expect delays in the pasta aisle," Dori Reilly of Inkster, MI, said Monday.

Indeed, it appears the goal of razing the two cities was not to purge the fornicators, but rather to purge the low-income residents who were making it difficult to attract outside investment.” Rosales added that the erroneous story found in religious texts might derive from the fact that, years later, God was forced to smite the luxury condominium residents due to their rampant, widespread practice of bestiality.</td></tr><tr style='background-color: #009879;color: #ffffff;text-align: left;' ><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >U.S. Warns Dozens Of Foreign Powers Have Access To Food</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >2021-12-02T10:15:00-06:00</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >WASHINGTON—Americans were urged to be on high alert Thursday after Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, warned that dozens of foreign powers have access to food. “Intelligence from our operatives across the globe reveals the disturbing reality that the vast majority of our potential foreign adversaries have stockpiles of food and would be willing to feed their populace, posing a direct threat to the American way of life,” said Milley, adding that officials were in possession of satellite photos of farms, grocery stores, and even grain silos in countries hostile to the United States. “We’re talking foreign powers like Cuba, Russia, and Venezuela—not to mention China—which, over the last decade, have accumulated countless stores of meats, rice, and vegetables.

We also found that over a 15-year, six-album span, there has been an alarming threefold jump in gun violence verses.” Larson warned that unplanned pregnancies could rise at any moment should a remastered version of The River be released.</td></tr><tr style='background-color: #009879;color: #ffffff;text-align: left;' ><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >Bangladesh Runs Out Of People</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >1996-12-03T15:00:17-06:00</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >DHAKA, BANGLADESH—A devastating typhoon claimed the lives of the final 290,000 people in Bangladesh Tuesday, reducing the Southeast Asian nation's population to zero.

An even larger amount, 20 percent, was worthy of muting the ad immediately, clicking over to a second tab, and then returning to the original page when the ad was estimated to be over.” Noren went on to say that not a single piece of internet content was worth sitting through a 30-second ad and speculated there almost certainly never would be.</td></tr><tr style='background-color: #009879;color: #ffffff;text-align: left;' ><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >New Study Finds Majority Of God’s Blessings Burn Up On Entry Into Atmosphere</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >2015-02-05T12:25:00-06:00</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >AUSTIN, TX—Noting that the chances of one reaching the planet’s surface are largely dependent on speed and angle of entry, a study released Thursday by the University of Texas Department of Astronomy found that the majority of blessings from God burn up while passing through Earth’s atmosphere. “We discovered that due to the thickness and density of the gases surrounding our planet, 80 percent of God’s graces will completely disintegrate by the time they are about 75 to 100 kilometers away from the surface,” said professor Donald Northcote, adding that his team’s observations suggest that roughly 19 million of the Lord’s blessings vaporize in the mesosphere on any given day. “Even the largest and most generous of God’s gifts will be reduced to many minute fragments of His original intention during the journey, and the rare blessing that reaches the ground will be much smaller than it was in Heaven.

We just want to ask Catholics out there: Would you send your child for such an initiative? Would you be okay with them leaving for several years to convert the Muslim bands occupying the land of Christ? And how does, say, May or June of next year sound? No pressure. We’d just like to know where everyone stands on this.” Burke went on to assure parents that if they ended up going forward with such a crusade, Vatican leaders would make sure to take precautions so that no children would be tricked into boarding cargo ships, sold as slaves in North Africa, and tortured into renouncing Christ.</td></tr><tr style='background-color: #009879;color: #ffffff;text-align: left;' ><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >Matt Gaetz Forced To Host Hundreds Of White Nationalists After Airbnb Pulls D.C.

To make matters worse, they are, at present, still asking for more dessert.” While Ehlers confirmed the naughty boys deserved a spanking, she went on to admit she could not stay mad at those adorable, chubby-cheeked faces for long.</td></tr><tr style='background-color: #009879;color: #ffffff;text-align: left;' ><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >U.S. Unveils Plan For Rest Of World To Become Carbon-Neutral By 2030</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >2020-02-24T08:15:00-06:00</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >WASHINGTON—Touting the measure as the most ambitious effort ever to tackle climate change on a global level, the United States unveiled a plan Monday for the rest of the world to become carbon-neutral by 2030. “Climate change is a serious threat to American livelihoods, which is why we have taken the unprecedented step of announcing that every single other country besides the United States will reduce their carbon emissions to zero over the next 10 years,” said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at a press conference unveiling the Washington Climate Agreement, which had 194 forced signatories representing every other country in the world. “As the world’s superpower, we know that it is incumbent on us to lead the way in the effort to fight global warming, and it’s why we will stop at nothing to ensure that every country besides America ends its dependence on fossil fuels. We commend our ambitious goals for other countries—France, for instance, is going carbon-neutral by 2022, and we’re especially gratified to see that China, under the terms of this agreement, will involuntarily offset all of America’s carbon emissions, which will be able to go up dramatically under this agreement. The Washington pact shows that if we Americans put our mind to it, there’s nothing we can’t compel other countries to do.” U.S. officials added that the plan would likely cause significant issues and economic hardship in emerging economies, but under the terms of the agreement, they didn’t care.</td></tr><tr style='background-color: #009879;color: #ffffff;text-align: left;' ><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >Cambridge Analytica Whistleblower Admits Last Few Weeks At Work Have Been Awkward</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >2018-04-13T13:43:00-05:00</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >LONDON—Noting that his treatment from colleagues recently ranged from avoiding eye contact by some to the occasional incident of spitting directly into his face by others, Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie admitted Friday that the last few weeks at work have been unusually awkward. “The vibe has really changed around here, if you ask me,” said the 29-year-old political operative, who suspects the recent coldness has something to do with his decision to reveal the massive scope of the company’s Facebook data mining operation to authorities. “I suppose it could just be my imagination, but it honestly feels like people don’t trust me much anymore.

But that quickly gave way to concern when they heard him badly slurring his command to baptize all nations in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. There’s also evidence suggesting that the motor loss required him to be carried to the Sea of Galilee and mash up most of his meals to aid with his difficulties swallowing.

Of course, being cats, they took to frottage instantly, but encouraging them to perform oral, let alone mutual oral, proved to be very challenging,” said zoologist Mason Shubaly, whose team tried numerous strategies from simply providing the big cats with soft lighting and sensual music to more radical techniques such as having zookeepers demonstrate the act. However, it was years before they could inspire the timid animals to “loop-the-loop.” “Zoos across the world have been attempting this feat for years, but it takes a combination of proper atmosphere, a bit of coordination, and the right kind of coaxing to get tigers to, shall we say, engage.

How was she supposed to have the energy to look after a bunch of hatchlings when she was busy all day using 12,000 pounds of bite force to crush the bones of her prey?” According to the paleontologists, the arrangement of fossils found at the site suggest the tyrannosaur was probably on her way to have her eggs thawed and fertilized for incubation when, along with most animal life on the planet, she was wiped out by a massive asteroid.</td></tr><tr style='background-color: #009879;color: #ffffff;text-align: left;' ><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >Nation Glad To See Baseball Players Still Have Names Like Mookie Betts</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >2020-10-21T19:00:00-05:00</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >ALTOONA, PA—Basking in delight and nostalgia as they watched the 2020 MLB World Series, the nation was reportedly glad Wednesday to see baseball players still have names like Mookie Betts. “There are very few things you can count on in this life, so seeing that there are still baseball players out there hustling in the outfield with names like Mookie Betts really gives me a sense of continuity and peace,” said local baseball fan Jim Cunningham, echoing Americans across the country who added that they worried after Chipper Jones, Pokey Reese, and Coco Crisp retired that the best years of baseball names were behind them, but seeing Mookie Betts grace their TV screens as the L.A.

It seems the faster they churn their little legs while curled up on their beds or favorite spots on the couch, the more intent they are about chewing off all your extremities and rooting around in your chest cavity. The quiet whimpers that you think are so sweet are actually coded pack signals calling all other canines in the neighborhood to come and satiate themselves upon your organs.” At press time, Michaels added that owners should be concerned if they see their dog licking themselves, as it may be an indicator that their pet has already slaughtered several victims and is meticulously cleaning blood from its fur.</td></tr><tr style='background-color: #009879;color: #ffffff;text-align: left;' ><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >Recurring Zhang Ziyi Fantasy Always Involves Getting Kicked In The Face</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >2004-11-03T15:00:12-06:00</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >EL CAJON, CA—Bradley Vogt, 24, said Monday that, although he often fantasizes about Beijing-born Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon star Zhang Ziyi, his dreams always abruptly end with her kicking him in the face.

Contrary to many doomsday scenarios, humanity will continue to exist on Earth until at least 2024—and maybe even longer, if we’re lucky.” At press time, Lansing added that the encouraging findings also indicated that human life could continue on as normal for as long as the next 24 to 48 hours.</td></tr><tr style='background-color: #009879;color: #ffffff;text-align: left;' ><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >Report: National Average Now 604</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >2013-09-10T09:04:00-05:00</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >WASHINGTON—According to the annual report released Monday by the Center for Global Statistics, the United States National Average reached 604 Monday, climbing up from 600 in the previous year. “While the data revealed that the U.S. National Average increased slightly in 2013, those numbers are still moderately lower than in the late 1990s when the USNA was at 615,”said Dr. Paul Lewison, the lead researcher who collected, analyzed, and interpreted the numerical information in the survey sample used to determine the National Average. “The National Average has certainly been known to fluctuate, so estimations that it could gain a point or two and reach the 605 or 606 range are not unwarranted.

Climate change is a global issue, so the time is now for animals to do their part to help protect the environment, and that means cows working to offset their carbon footprint, birds cutting down on excess travel, and fish having fewer children. We also urge animals to become more politically involved by contacting their member of Congress and demand the government focus on regulatory measures and promoting renewable technology—consider writing a letter to your representative.” Researchers followed up their advice to animals with several recommendations for plants that aren’t currently doing enough to fight climate change.</td></tr><tr style='background-color: #009879;color: #ffffff;text-align: left;' ><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >Creepy Weirdo Still Stalking You On Facebook</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >2018-06-14T13:39:00-05:00</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >MENLO PARK, CA—Looking at all your posts and pictures a long time after he should have stopped, a creepy weirdo was still stalking you on Facebook, sources confirmed Thursday.

Allure of the Seas sank a Carnival Cruise Line ship that crossed into disputed waters off the coast of the Bahamas, sources said Thursday.The Allure, an Oasis-class recreational vessel with a standing crew of around 2,300, opened fire on Carnival’s M.S. Magic after it allegedly ignored repeated warnings not to approach Coco Cay, a private island owned by Royal Caribbean. After sustaining several direct hits, the enemy ship’s hull reportedly ruptured, immediately flooding its bingo hall and spa with seawater, collapsing several theme restaurants, and ultimately killing all 3,675 guests on board.“By approaching within three nautical miles of Coco Cay, the M.S. Magic was in direct violation of the terms of the 2011 Caribbean Nights cease-fire agreement,” said Captain David Beeman of the Allure, stating that the attack was necessary to safeguard the recreational interests of the customers he is sworn to serve. “Per standard procedure, our limbo emcee first alerted the Magic that it had entered our territorial waters by issuing a verbal warning and blasting conga music over our PA system. When the ship refused to change course, we proceeded to launch a broadside from our starboard cannons, delivering a direct hit to their most crucial facilities, including the engine room, water slide, and Red Frog rum bar.”“We suffered just one casualty ourselves, losing a tango instructor to friendly fire,” he added.Pulling up alongside the smaller enemy vessel, the 1,187-foot Allure reportedly extended its powerful battery of guns from the portholes of a lower-deck theater currently staging Mamma Mia! Witnesses said Magic patrons standing in line for the 24-hour seafood buffet had little time to take cover before the Allure opened fire, scattering body parts and shrimp scampi all over the ship’s pool deck and mini-golf course.Today, Samsung unveiled everything new in its lineup of Galaxy products. Bundle a pair of Buds 2 Pro with either a Watch5 or Watch5 Pro with the Z Fold4 to receive $300 in Samsung credit.“When the first shells hit, you could see blasted sections of the hull, bloody scraps of cargo shorts, and flaming flip-flops raining down into the ocean all around,” said Allure passenger Nicole Rice, adding that a few Magic guests tried to run for safety behind overturned massage tables, but were set upon by a Royal Caribbean boarding party that had crossed over with the assistance of their ship’s zip-line and ropes-course operators. “Once the second round of fire took out the piano bar and Guy Fieri’s Burger Joint, it was pretty much all over. The Magic had just dropped anchor for the Dune Buggy Heritage Adventure Tour, so it really had no chance of escape.”Maritime historians are calling the attack upon the Magic the deadliest encounter between rival ocean liners since the so-called Cruise Wars of the 1990s, when the wrecks of sunken pleasure vessels littered the waters from Fort Lauderdale to St. Kitts. During that era, the upstart Disney Cruise Line came to rule the waves, and marauders dressed as Pinocchio, Goofy, Tinker Bell, and other company-owned mascots were known to slit the throats of their competitors’ guests and plunder everything from bar supplies to blackjack tables to karaoke equipment.Despite official explanations, Thursday’s attack is actually believed to be in retaliation for a 2013 incident in which a Royal Caribbean vessel on a nine-day Best of the Bahamas cruise was captured off the coast of Paradise Island. According to deck logs, its entire passenger list was impressed into service as caterers aboard Carnival’s Breeze flagship.“I’ll never forget the sight of the Magic’s crew and guests desperately trying to bail out the Club O2 teen zone as the ship started to tilt, causing all the deck furniture, the ice cream sundae station, and those seniors on their church group trip to go sliding off into the sea,” Allure passenger Jason Heidt said. “Then I guess they lost power, because suddenly all the party lights shut off and everyone in the Punchliner comedy club went silent as the ship capsized.”“Everyone except Joe Rogan,” Heidt continued. “He kept on telling jokes until he was completely underwater.”</td></tr><tr style='background-color: #009879;color: #ffffff;text-align: left;' ><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >OSHA Special Ops Team Raids Local Office After Receiving Intel On Expired Fire Extinguisher</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >2019-06-27T08:09:00-05:00</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >OMAHA, NE—OSHA Special Ops recon scouts abseiled through skylights as breach-teams crashed simultaneously through multiple windows with drawn M4 carbines Thursday to launch an Occupational Safety and Health Administration raid on a local office, mere hours after receiving intel on a possible expired fire extinguisher. “Stay down, you non-flame-retardant motherfuckers—hands on the backs of your heads,” said OSHA Bravo Team leader Col.

A large percentage of millennials will even go so far as to reject the Tenures Abolition Act of 1660 entirely.” Mayberry also noted that the trend extended to Gen Z, which has advocated for doing away with political systems entirely and returning to a state of nature.</td></tr><tr style='background-color: #009879;color: #ffffff;text-align: left;' ><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >Laughter Now Exclusively Used To Mask Feelings</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >1999-01-27T15:00:12-06:00</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >WASHINGTON, DC—According to a study released Tuesday by the National Institute of Emotional Studies, laughter, long employed as a cathartic response to absurd or humorous stimuli, is now used solely to conceal contempt and fear from fellow human beings.

"Today, 50 percent of all laughter is used as sarcastic mockery of failed attempts at humor, with the remaining 50 percent used to create the illusion of comfort in situations involving tension or deceit."

However, according to our findings, roughly two-thirds of all U.S. citizens reach age 65 with only gardening, basic woodworking, and card games to fill their hours,” said lead researcher Robert Wallach, noting that many retirees find themselves exhausting the potential of their activities within the first five years, ultimately making do with walks in the park, stilted phone calls to friends, and miscellaneous unguided puttering. “Unfortunately, what happens is that young people tend to overestimate their side-interest-management skills while simultaneously underestimating their importance, and as a result are left with barely anything to do in their golden years beyond reading. This is, of course, nowhere near enough for the average American to get by on, which is why we recommend putting your resources into, say, fishing and painting as early as possible.” The report also suggested that retirees often found themselves in short supply of hobbies due in part to the American tendency to blow through everything they deem interesting during their twenties and thirties.</td></tr><tr style='background-color: #009879;color: #ffffff;text-align: left;' ><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >Mars Introduces New Crab-Stuffed M&M’s</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >2022-05-04T13:10:00-05:00</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >MCLEAN, VA—Stating that its latest confection was equally suitable as a movie snack or an hors-d’oeuvre, multinational candy manufacturer Mars Inc. announced Wednesday that it had begun selling a new savory crab-stuffed M&M. “At long last, classic varieties such as original, peanut, and almond will be joined by an M&M that pairs our beloved mouthwatering chocolate with a surprisingly powerful blast of flavor from a morsel of fresh-caught Alaskan crab,” a company press release read in part, noting that in addition to milk chocolate and 0.02 ounces of crab meat, each bite-sized piece included a dollop of cream cheese and a proprietary blend of Cajun-style herbs and spices inside a signature M&M candy shell. “Crab-stuffed M&M’s make a wonderful, complex amuse-bouche that can be enjoyed at any cocktail party or gathering of friends—especially when served alongside our bacon-wrapped Starbursts or 3-Musketeers-and-cheddar quiche cups.

This is an important first step in catching up to the modern, ultra-fast creeks seen in highly advanced Asian countrysides.” While favored by the Obama administration, high-speed creeks have been criticized by a number of experts as poor investments better suited for the smaller backcountries of Europe and Japan, with many arguing that America’s abundance of vast open expanses meant the Interior Department should instead focus its energies on improving and facilitating the nation’s gusts.</td></tr><tr style='background-color: #009879;color: #ffffff;text-align: left;' ><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >Man On Vacation Suddenly Realizes No One Feeding His Hostages</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >2014-01-30T15:30:00-06:00</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >KEY WEST, FL—Midway through his weeklong Florida vacation, Salt Lake City resident Travis Lawson reportedly panicked today upon suddenly realizing he hadn’t arranged for anyone to feed his hostages while he was out of town. “Oh man, I was in such a hurry to hit the road, I totally forgot to have someone come over to my place and make sure Dennis, Jean, and Carly get their daily meal,” Lawson told reporters, referring to his three neglected captives, one of whom, their captor lamented, had nobody to administer her insulin shots. “Just thinking about them all alone and scared, locked in their cages, not knowing if I’ll ever come back—it makes me feel awful.

Once they’ve made a selection, they’ll typically check in with their surrogate at key points throughout the pregnancy, birth, and childhood until their son or daughter has grown into a young adult.” Tooley went on to note that in many cases, surrogates often become too attached to the child and have difficulties giving it up after carrying it to term, raising it, and then sending it off to college.</td></tr><tr style='background-color: #009879;color: #ffffff;text-align: left;' ><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >Milosevic Dreams He's Slaughtering Ethnic Albanians In His Underwear</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >1999-05-19T15:00:14-05:00</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >BELGRADE, YUGOSLAVIA—In an incident he described as "really freaky," Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic dreamed he was ordering the slaughter of tens of thousands of Kosovars while clad only in his underwear Tuesday.

And for optimal results, we strongly recommend getting into a regular routine of repeating this process every half year or so.” The surgeon general also recommended that all Americans spend three and a half days on whatever the current fad diet is any time they find themselves feeling particularly guilty about the amount of fast food they’ve been consuming.</td></tr><tr style='background-color: #009879;color: #ffffff;text-align: left;' ><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >EPA Warns Human Beings No Longer Biodegradable</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >2007-07-26T00:01:24-05:00</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >WASHINGTON, DC—The Environmental Protection Agency issued a bulletin Tuesday warning the bodies of American citizens, with their large concentrations of artificial, synthetic, and often toxic substances, have been reclassified as industrial waste.

The faster you can leave your home, the more likely you are to survive, even if you now realize that your days of running will never truly be behind you.” Fenton went on to say that every American should also have a first aid kit in their go-bag in case a bullet catches them just as they turn the corner.</td></tr><tr style='background-color: #009879;color: #ffffff;text-align: left;' ><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >Report: 57% Of All Activism Involves Petitions To Bring Back Discontinued Food Items</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >2014-08-29T20:28:00-05:00</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >WASHINGTON—According to a report released this week by the Pew Research Center, more than half of all activism in the United States now involves petitioning corporations to bring back beloved, discontinued food items. “Our research has found that some 57 percent of the nation’s social demonstrations and grassroots movements are primarily motivated by citizens’ desire to ensure that a limited-edition potato chip flavor is made permanently available or to reinstate a promotional fast food menu item,” said the report’s lead author, Rebecca Sullivan, noting that Americans’ collective demand for the return of a given candy bar’s dark-chocolate or peanut-butter-filled iterations far outstripped their involvement in organized efforts to exonerate innocent prisoners, support third-party presidential candidates, or reverse the effects of global climate change. “We found that popular efforts to expedite the return of seasonal coffee offerings or revive a struggling cartoon-crossover cereal required activists to dedicate whole weeks to social media campaigns, community outreach programs, and personal entreaties to multinational companies.

No one, no matter their circumstances in life, should fear the consequences of receiving an abortion and still having agency over their own life.” At press time, Parson signed an executive trigger law codifying the right to be put to death for inquiring about contraception.</td></tr><tr style='background-color: #009879;color: #ffffff;text-align: left;' ><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >God Recounts Torrid Affair With Michelangelo That Began When Posing For Sistine Chapel Fresco</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >2019-12-11T11:38:00-06:00</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >THE HEAVENS—Calling the years of the whirlwind romance amongst the greatest of His life, Supreme Being and Creator of All Things God recounted Wednesday the torrid affair with 16th-century Italian artist Michelangelo that began when He posed for the Sistine Chapel fresco The Creation Of Adam. “At first, we agreed to keep My modeling strictly professional, but a friendship slowly blossomed, and as he began to study My contours, it grew into something far more sensual,” said the Lord Almighty, who recalled tender evenings in the summer of 1508 spent bonding over glasses of wine, a practice that eventually led to the omnipotent deity agreeing to let the Renaissance master sketch Him nude. “Of course, it was once I disrobed that sparks really started to fly, but it was never just a physical thing between us. We really clicked on an emotional level, too. Some might think it’s demeaning to serve as another’s muse, but for Me there’s something incredibly romantic about the relationship. When I look at the final product, every stroke of the painting, every tiny detail, evokes the flame that burned in his heart for Me. I mean, those two fingers you see touching in the painting? That was our thing in bed.” God went on to note that all of this made it especially hard to have to kill Michelangelo a mere half century later.</td></tr><tr style='background-color: #009879;color: #ffffff;text-align: left;' ><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >Hollywood Diet Secrets Fall Into Non-Celebrity Hands</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >2000-11-29T15:00:11-06:00</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >HOLLYWOOD– In a major Hollywood security leak, an Encino, CA, company has made "Weight-Loss Secrets Of The Stars" available to the non-famous.

In fact, we found that most people spend an aggregate of three weeks each year just trying to maneuver out of the way of someone walking straight toward them.” The study also determined that 65 percent of the average person’s life is spent not paying attention to where the fuck they’re going.</td></tr><tr style='background-color: #009879;color: #ffffff;text-align: left;' ><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >Lines Come To Standstill Outside Wisconsin Polls After State’s Official Voting Pen Rolls Under Vending Machine</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >2020-10-28T14:35:00-05:00</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >MADISON—Authorities confirmed Wednesday that the already long six-hour lines had come to a standstill at Wisconsin polls after the state’s official voting pen rolled under a vending machine. “We regret to inform voters that earlier today, an elderly poll worker mistakenly dropped the only available voting pen in all of Wisconsin and watched helplessly as it went past the bubbler and got stuck in a dark, hard to reach corner,” said Wisconsin Elections Commission spokesperson Katheryn Vanderheyden, adding that already overrun polls would be closed statewide until the writing utensil, which was the only utensil allowed to be used to cast a vote since 1978, could be located and returned. “As of this morning, we know that the pen is pert’ near the back.

Of course, one must engage oneself completely in the study and practice of being sexually abused in order for the sacrament to be fully administered, and once being initiated, you are expected to teach these practices to future generations.

For best results, it is advised that users stay away from mirrors and other reflective surfaces entirely during the course of treatment.” The label went on to warn that the side effects of viewing oneself in the mirror while on Lexapro—which ranged from loss of appetite to suicidal thoughts—were likely to be significantly intensified should the user look at himself or herself unclothed.</td></tr><tr style='background-color: #009879;color: #ffffff;text-align: left;' ><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >Nation Praying For Super Nasty Luge Accident</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >2018-02-12T13:41:00-06:00</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >WASHINGTON—Expressing a deep desire to see an unbelievably gut-wrenching and epic crash, Americans across the country were reportedly praying Monday for a super nasty luge accident. “I’m just hoping we get a chance to watch a guy lose control of the sled, slam really hard into the wall, and then go tumbling down the ice track head over heels like a fucking rag doll,” said Dayton, OH resident Peter Murphy, echoing the sentiment of 323 million Americans who were wishing for the opportunity to witness a luge competitor wildly careen sideways down the incline, fall off the sled, and painfully roll down the course until their immobile body glides across the finish line. “God, please just let me see someone fly up high into the air over the side of the track and then plunge face-first into a snowbank.

Many shop owners would be happy to put out a bowl of water for a rhino, alleys provide plenty of shade, and poachers are much less common. However, they will have to learn how to dodge traffic.” Duale did note that relocating to urban areas could bring rhinos into competition with the hippos and wildebeest already vying for alleyway food sources.</td></tr><tr style='background-color: #009879;color: #ffffff;text-align: left;' ><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >Winchester Widens Consumer Reach With New 4.50-Caliber Bullets For Non-Gun Owners To Pelt Targets With</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >2019-09-04T08:45:00-05:00</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >NEW HAVEN, CT—In an effort to court non-firearm-owning Americans who have been unable to experience the feeling of riddling objects with lead projectiles, arms manufacturer Winchester released Wednesday a new 4.50-caliber bullet with which even non-gun owners can pelt their target. “We’re excited to offer all Americans the freedoms that, until now, were enjoyed solely by gun owners, as our new line of chuckable four-and-a-half-inch-wide cartridges has been designed to load seamlessly into your pocket, held in the palm of your hand, and thrown at anything or anyone you wish to attack,” said Winchester vice president of ammunition Lyle Baxter, who noted that the new bullet is specially engineered for short-range flinging and is ideal for anyone who is, for whatever reason, barred from owning one of Winchester’s signature rifles but still wants to give someone a nasty little welt, bruise, or concussion. “This super-sleek steel round can be used by kids, adults, families seeking protection, and just about anyone who wants to beam someone from a few feet away with an object only a little larger than—but just as American as—a baseball.

A list of our interests starts and ends with the word ‘logs.’ We wake up each morning champing at the bit to chop more logs, and every second we’re not spending in a lumberyard, a forest, or the woods is a second wasted. We love how logs smell, we love how they feel, we love their shape, and we just can’t contain ourselves when we’re moving a log around with a logging crane. Logs in the morning, logs at night, and in between? Logs. Turn them into paper, turn them into timber, log our logs in the log log and then log into our logging blog.

It completely upended our entire understanding of the material universe, but we tried explaining it to some other scientists and they were clearly just acting like they got it.” At press time, the NASA scientists were annoying other researchers by cracking up about inside terminology that could only be understood by those who knew the details of the discovery.</td></tr><tr style='background-color: #009879;color: #ffffff;text-align: left;' ><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >Strange New Culture Forming On Other End Of Office</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >2013-06-07T11:47:00-05:00</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >HOUSTON—Pointing to the group’s radically divergent behaviors and customs, employees at local software firm Pendant Systems confirmed Friday that a strange new culture appears to be forming among their coworkers at the other end of the office. “Somehow, the account management team has forged a society all its own, one that is markedly different from anything we’ve ever seen among the cubicles on this floor,” product development chief Stephen Cheng said of the curious micro-civilization, noting its inhabitants display highly unique work habits and modes of dress. “Within their isolated community, they appear to have developed their own power structure, and they often communicate in a bizarre, shorthand language of inside jokes that no one from outside the group can understand.

Larry, our boa constrictor, regularly uses his body to make the letters J, L, and I, and we’re working around the clock to figure out what he’s saying. In the meantime, we gave him a kitten, as that’s what Koko the famous gorilla asked for when she learned to sign. It’s been several kittens by now, in fact, because they seem to keep getting caught in the O’s and we’re not sure Larry has learned the signs for ‘let go’ yet.” Dr. Hutchinson also said researchers believe the snakes are probably capable of teaching sign language to their young after witnessing entire snake families simultaneously making the letter S.</td></tr><tr style='background-color: #009879;color: #ffffff;text-align: left;' ><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >Febreze Releases New Air Horn For Covering Up Unpleasant Bathroom Sounds</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >2018-10-10T11:34:00-05:00</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >CINCINNATI, OH—Calling the device the perfect addition to any bathroom with loud acoustics or thin walls, Febreze officials announced Wednesday that the company had released a new air horn for covering up unpleasant bathroom sounds. “Pesky, embarrassing bodily functions are simply no match for Febreze’s new ThunderClap Air Horn—just one deafening blast, and that’s all anyone will hear,” said company spokesperson Clara Jung, adding that their product’s specialized, high-pitched siren was specifically designed to hide reverberations up to volumes of 15 decibels. “From routine bathroom sounds to something as loud as a groan, Febreze’s new air horn can mask it all.

In almost every case, however, this conclusion is arrived at without speaking a single word or getting a look at the stranger staring out through the black mesh mouth of the character’s oversize head.” A related report revealed that 97 percent of children only feel truly safe and happy when an anonymous person in a character costume embraces them.</td></tr><tr style='background-color: #009879;color: #ffffff;text-align: left;' ><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >Outback Employees Return From Mandatory 6-Month Walkabout In Australian Wilderness</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >2018-01-25T14:28:00-06:00</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >NULLARBOR PLAIN, AUSTRALIA—Having completed the ritualistic journey from inexperienced trainees to enlightened servers, hostesses, and line cooks, employees at Outback Steakhouse reportedly returned from their mandatory six-month walkabout in the Australian wilderness Thursday. “This rite of passage, in which participants spend half a year traversing the arid bush and salt pans of Australia’s vast, remote heartland, is required of all trainees before they take on any shifts to ensure they are spiritually in tune with the bold flavors and signature dishes that keep our customers coming back,” said Outback CEO Elizabeth Smith of the miles-long journey that forces those undertaking it to learn the skills necessary to make a Bloomin’ Onion or Kiwi ’Rita while having to live off the land and protect themselves from the harsh climate and dangerous wildlife of the continent’s interior tundra. “Of the 80 who were sent out into the sand plains of the subtropical savannah with nothing but their uniforms and a pair of tongs, 17 unfortunately didn’t make it back due to starvation, dehydration, and snake bites; however, 53 successfully returned, having formed a powerful awareness of our famous Aussie-tizers and Joey Menu.

A responsible and well-trained gun owner should be able to kill twice that many people with just one high-capacity magazine,” said NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre, who advised Americans not to take the incidents in Virginia Beach or Poway as an indicator of the lethality of semi-automatic AR-15 style rifles, which are designed to generate far bloodier outcomes. “Gun deaths are a mental health issue; we can’t ignore that the shooters were suffering, therefore they were far less efficient marksmen. Had they been mentally well, they could have exercised better trigger control and framed their targets more clearly in the sights, turning misses into hits and wounded victims into fatalities. The NRA firmly believes the death toll of these past few months does not nearly reflect how deadly these guns should be.” LaPierre noted that the 2016 Orlando shooting and the 2017 Las Vegas shooting far more accurately represented what firearms can really do.</td></tr><tr style='background-color: #009879;color: #ffffff;text-align: left;' ><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >Study: Depression Up Among Teenage Girls Able To Perceive Any Part Of World Around Them</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >2016-11-28T11:02:00-06:00</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >WALTHAM, MA—Calling it nothing short of a mental health crisis for the group, a study published Monday in The New England Journal Of Medicine found that depression was up sharply among teenage girls able to perceive any part of the world around them. “Our research has shown a significant increase in anxiety and depression among 13- to 19-year-old girls who are capable of taking in stimuli from their surroundings and processing them into an understanding of the outside world,” said study author Natalie Ogilvy, adding that an ability to observe day-to-day existence, comprehend media, or register any of their own personal experiences were among some of the strongest predictors of emotional difficulties for teenage girls­. “In addition, we noticed even more pronounced depressive symptoms among female adolescents who not only can perceive their environment, but who also have the capacity to retain memories of what they have witnessed. Teenage girls who are able to imagine themselves even seconds into their future circumstances were the most vulnerable of them all.” While depression peaked among teenage girls able to perceive the world around them, the researchers also found that it manifested itself in early childhood or even infancy, particularly among newborn girls able to open their eyes.</td></tr><tr style='background-color: #009879;color: #ffffff;text-align: left;' ><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >Modern-Day Lancelot Offers To Pay For Abortion</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >2015-01-28T14:14:00-06:00</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >ST.

If we do not drastically change our behavior, it’s very possible that future generations might grow up in a world where a comfortable buffer zone between them and others simply doesn’t exist.” The U.N. report warned that the worldwide loss of personal space was rapidly approaching a critical tipping point, placing the global population at extreme risk of catastrophic crowding and jostling.</td></tr><tr style='background-color: #009879;color: #ffffff;text-align: left;' ><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >Area Man Going To Great Lengths To Conceal His Perfectly Normal Behavior</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >2010-07-21T09:00:00-05:00</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >DENVER—Local account manager Kevin Verhulst turned off his phone, lied to coworkers, and left work early Wednesday in an elaborate ploy to prevent anyone from knowing that he was about to engage in behavior that would, at worst, be characterized as "everyday."

Although there’s much to be sorted out in terms of feeding schedules, what’s important now is that we focus on making this an easy transition for 2-year-old Bei Bei, over whom the pandas will share joint custody.” Brown-Palsgrove went on to say that in order to respect their privacy during this difficult time, the 24-hour panda cam will be turned off.</td></tr><tr style='background-color: #009879;color: #ffffff;text-align: left;' ><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >Nation Sick Of Looming Stuff</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >2013-09-24T13:25:00-05:00</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >WASHINGTON—Noting the ceaseless onslaught of issues constantly nearing the eleventh hour, Americans across the country told reporters Tuesday they are sick and tired of all this looming stuff. “Frankly, I would like a week to go by where I don’t hear about some sort of showdown or crisis that is looming, or brewing, or rearing its head, or anything like that,” said 34-year-old Matawan, NJ resident Jonathan Lear, echoing the thoughts of all 315 million U.S. citizens who have expressed a strong desire for the nation to take a break from either approaching or being on the cusp of anything at all, including conflicts, deadlines, decisions, battles, something ending, something beginning, something getting worse, or something getting even worse. “I don’t want to hear about how another bad or difficult thing we need to avoid is ‘on the horizon’ or ‘right around the corner.’ Just let all the horrible impending shit that’s going to happen happen so we can at least get it over with and move on with our lives.” The American populace did confirm, however, that they are more than happy to hear about anything that is in the nation’s rearview mirror.</td></tr><tr style='background-color: #009879;color: #ffffff;text-align: left;' ><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >USDA Rolls Out New School Brunch Program For Wealthier School Districts</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >2013-04-26T12:20:00-05:00</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >WASHINGTON—Declaring that every affluent child in America has the right to a well-balanced brunch, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced the launch of a $40 million school brunch program aimed at distributing brioche french toast and smoked salmon to the nation’s richest school districts. “We found that 70 percent of students in wealthy communities were not receiving their recommended allowance of eggs Benedict and fresh-squeezed orange juice,” Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack told reporters Friday. “Quite simply, we believe all children of privilege deserve a proper, well-composed brunch plate with complimentary jalapeno cornbread mini muffins and honey butter on the side.

Our analysis also shows that, given how often celebrities like Ryan Gosling, Selena Gomez, and the Hemsworth brothers have sex, they are probably incredible at it. In addition, a degree of status is conferred upon anyone who has sex with a major star, as they are forever known within their social group as the one who had sex with Drake or Kristen Stewart.” Mulbin added that even in the worst-case scenario, in which a person contracts an incurable STI from an A-list celebrity, the accompanying sexual gratification would still “totally be worth it.”</td></tr><tr style='background-color: #009879;color: #ffffff;text-align: left;' ><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >Report: Majority Of Psychological Experiments Conducted In 1970s Just Crimes</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >2020-12-07T10:20:00-06:00</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >WASHINGTON—Unable to discern any legitimate form of inquiry in the past procedures, a new report released Monday by the American Psychological Association found that nearly eight out of every 10 psychological experiments conducted in the 1970s were just crimes. “After analyzing hundreds of academic papers from the decade, we found that 79% of these experiments served no scientific purpose, but  in most cases were conducted simply to inflict pain and distress on their test subjects,” the report read in part, adding that the studies, in which participants were sometimes electrocuted repeatedly or locked in a dark basement for days on end without food or water, did little to advance knowledge and constituted very serious felonies in all 50 states. “Much of the time these researchers didn’t even bother to test a hypothesis or collect data, but instead just tortured student volunteers for amusement by burning them with hot irons or beating them over and over again with a sack of hammers. However, not all experiments that broke the law involved physical or emotional agony. We also found a 1974 study at Yale in which PhD candidates were given a $30,000 grant to just do a bunch of cocaine without any apparent research goals.” The report went on to mention that the remaining 21% of experiments, while not rising to the level of crimes, were still flat-out racist.</td></tr><tr style='background-color: #009879;color: #ffffff;text-align: left;' ><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >U.S. Sends Military Advisors To Peace-Ravaged Country</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >2022-01-31T07:00:00-06:00</td><td style='border: 3px solid black; border-bottom: 1px solid #dddddd;' >WASHINGTON—Declaring that the current state of affairs had gone on long enough, U.S. officials announced Monday that they were sending military advisors to the peace-ravaged country of Finland. “Starting next month, we’re deploying a team of our most dedicated and belligerent officials to Finland in an effort to finally bring some war and chaos to the region,” said Secretary of State Tony Blinken, adding that the U.S. felt obligated as a global leader to ensure that countries long devastated by decades of brutal peace had the means to finally achieve war. “We have of course tried diplomatic means to end peace in this region, but so far have been unsuccessful, which is why military measures are now deemed necessary. There is a complete lack of religious or ethnic tension that has been stoked by outside foreign powers.
